# How to harden a HAProxy container (and is haproxy:3.1-alpine safe at your edge?)

HAProxy sits in the request path: it terminates TLS, load-balances every inbound connection, and is the first thing an attacker reaches. A stock `docker run haproxy:3.1-alpine` is better than most edge images out of the box because it runs non-root, but it is not yet the boundary that role deserves. Graded on IronClaw's seven-dimension containment scale, the default configuration scores **63 of 100, grade C (weak)**. Higher is safer. A few runtime flags take the same image to **89 of 100, grade B**, and the one dimension it cannot reach (`network=none`) is the one a load balancer needs by definition: it exists to accept and forward traffic. Here are the exact gaps and fixes from the scan data.

> Every number here comes from a running container scan of `haproxy:3.1-alpine`, the same data behind its [isolation scorecard](../scores/haproxy.md). No workload is executed. [How scoring works &rarr;](../scan.md)

## Where the default configuration leaks

`ironctl scan` grades seven independent containment boundaries. On a default `docker run haproxy:3.1-alpine`, four dimensions flag warnings. It already runs as a non-root user, which is why it starts a full grade above most edge images:

| Dimension | Verdict | Score | What the scan found |
|-----------|:-------:|------:|---------------------|
| Non-root user (uid != 0) | ✅ PASS | 15/15 | runs as haproxy (uid != 0) |
| Dropped capabilities | ⚠️ WARN | 4/20 | default capability set retained (CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_MKNOD, and more) |
| Seccomp profile | ✅ PASS | 15/15 | seccomp profile active |
| Network isolation / egress | ⚠️ WARN | 4/15 | standard bridge network mode reported |
| Read-only root filesystem | ⚠️ WARN | 5/15 | root filesystem is writable |
| Privilege escalation | ⚠️ WARN | 5/10 | no explicitly enforced no-new-privileges |
| No shared host namespaces | ✅ PASS | 10/10 | no host PID/IPC/network sharing |

HAProxy already gets the hardest dimension right by running as a non-root user (`haproxy`, UID 99). The main gaps that remain are the **retained capability set** and the **writable rootfs**. HAProxy parses attacker-controlled bytes on every request; a routing or TLS vulnerability that lands code execution leaves `CAP_NET_RAW` available to craft raw packets and a writable rootfs to persist. Neither is needed to forward traffic.

## Harden it: the exact remediation steps

For `haproxy:3.1-alpine`:

- **`--cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE`** (Dropped capabilities, +16 pts): drop every Linux capability; retain only `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` if you must bind to privileged ports (< 1024, e.g., 80/443 directly).
- **`--read-only --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /var/run`** (Read-only rootfs, +10 pts): make the root filesystem read-only. Mount in-memory filesystems (`tmpfs`) for `/tmp` and `/var/run` so runtime sockets and PID files can be created safely.
- **`--security-opt=no-new-privileges:true`** (Privilege Escalation): prevent child processes from gaining elevated privileges via `setuid` or `setgid` binaries.

## Before and after

```bash
# Before: 63/100, grade C
docker run -d --name haproxy haproxy:3.1-alpine

# After: 89/100, grade B
docker run -d --name haproxy-hardened \
  --user 99:99 \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges:true \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  --tmpfs /var/run \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  haproxy:3.1-alpine
```

`ironctl scan` also reads a `docker-compose.yml` service or a Kubernetes manifest, so you can grade
the Traefik in your stack, not just a bare `docker run`.
